# Number-to-Word
ðŸ“œ Number to Words Converter: This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web app that converts a number (from 0 to 999) into its corresponding English word form. Users can input any 3-digit number and instantly see its textual representation. 
Explaination: This project is a Number to Words Converter built using basic web technologies â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user enters a number between 0 and 999, and the app converts it into its English word equivalent.

The input is validated to ensure only numbers in the valid range are accepted.

Internally, it uses arrays to map numbers to their word forms:

units[] handles numbers from 0 to 19.

tens[] handles multiples of 10 from 20 to 90.

hundreds[] maps hundreds (100, 200, etc.).

The output is displayed dynamically on the page.

The UI includes a soft-styled container with a background image and basic animations for an enhanced user experience.

This project is ideal for beginners to understand DOM manipulation, number formatting logic, and styling with CSS.
